%changelog
* Thu Nov 16 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.15.0-0
- Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
  'everything matches' is still warned and Git asks users to use a
  more explicit '.' for that instead.  The hope is that existing
  users will not mind this change, and eventually the warning can be
  turned into a hard error, upgrading the deprecation into removal of
  this (mis)feature.  That is now scheduled to happen in Git v2.16,
  the next major release after this one.
- Git now avoids blindly falling back to ".git" when the setup
  sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.  A corner case that
  happens to work right now may be broken by a call to BUG().
  We've tried hard to locate such cases and fixed them, but there
  might still be cases that need to be addressed--bug reports are
  greatly appreciated.
- "branch --set-upstream" that has been deprecated in Git 1.8 has
  finally been retired.
- An example that is now obsolete has been removed from a sample hook,
  and an old example in it that added a sign-off manually has been
  improved to use the interpret-trailers command.
- The advice message given when "git rebase" stops for conflicting
  changes has been improved.
- The "rerere-train" script (in contrib/) learned the "--overwrite"
  option to allow overwriting existing recorded resolutions.
- "git contacts" (in contrib/) now lists the address on the
  "Reported-by:" trailer to its output, in addition to those on
  S-o-b: and other trailers, to make it easier to notify (and thank)
  the original bug reporter.
- "git rebase", especially when it is run by mistake and ends up
  trying to replay many changes, spent long time in silence.  The
  command has been taught to show progress report when it spends
  long time preparing these many changes to replay (which would give
  the user a chance to abort with ^C).
- "git merge" learned a "--signoff" option to add the Signed-off-by:
  trailer with the committer's name.
- "git diff" learned to optionally paint new lines that are the same
  as deleted lines elsewhere differently from genuinely new lines.
- "git interpret-trailers" learned to take the trailer specifications
  from the command line that overrides the configured values.
- "git interpret-trailers" has been taught a "--parse" and a few
  other options to make it easier for scripts to grab existing
  trailer lines from a commit log message.
- The "--format=%%(trailers)" option "git log" and its friends take
  learned to take the 'unfold' and 'only' modifiers to normalize its
  output, e.g. "git log --format=%%(trailers:only,unfold)".
- "gitweb" shows a link to visit the 'raw' contents of blobs in the
  history overview page.
- "[gc] rerereResolved = 5.days" used to be invalid, as the variable
  is defined to take an integer counting the number of days.  It now
  is allowed.
- The code to acquire a lock on a reference (e.g. while accepting a
  push from a client) used to immediately fail when the reference is
  already locked---now it waits for a very short while and retries,
  which can make it succeed if the lock holder was holding it during
  a read-only operation.
- "branch --set-upstream" that has been deprecated in Git 1.8 has
  finally been retired.
- The codepath to call external process filter for smudge/clean
  operation learned to show the progress meter.
- "git rev-parse" learned "--is-shallow-repository", that is to be
  used in a way similar to existing "--is-bare-repository" and
  friends.
- "git describe --match <pattern>" has been taught to play well with
  the "--all" option.
- "git branch" learned "-c/-C" to create a new branch by copying an
  existing one.
- Some commands (most notably "git status") makes an opportunistic
  update when performing a read-only operation to help optimize later
  operations in the same repository.  The new "--no-optional-locks"
  option can be passed to Git to disable them.
- "git for-each-ref --format=..." learned a new format element,
  %%(trailers), to show only the commit log trailer part of the log
  message.
- Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.
- Start using selected c99 constructs in small, stable and
  essential part of the system to catch people who care about
  older compilers that do not grok them.
- The filter-process interface learned to allow a process with long
  latency give a "delayed" response.
- Many uses of comparison callback function the hashmap API uses
  cast the callback function type when registering it to
  hashmap_init(), which defeats the compile time type checking when
  the callback interface changes (e.g. gaining more parameters).
  The callback implementations have been updated to take "void *"
  pointers and cast them to the type they expect instead.
- Because recent Git for Windows do come with a real msgfmt, the
  build procedure for git-gui has been updated to use it instead of a
  hand-rolled substitute.
- "git grep --recurse-submodules" has been reworked to give a more
  consistent output across submodule boundary (and do its thing
  without having to fork a separate process).
- A helper function to read a single whole line into strbuf
  mistakenly triggered OOM error at EOF under certain conditions,
  which has been fixed.
- The "ref-store" code reorganization continues.
- "git commit" used to discard the index and re-read from the filesystem
  just in case the pre-commit hook has updated it in the middle; this
  has been optimized out when we know we do not run the pre-commit hook.
- Updates to the HTTP layer we made recently unconditionally used
  features of libCurl without checking the existence of them, causing
  compilation errors, which has been fixed.  Also migrate the code to
  check feature macros, not version numbers, to cope better with
  libCurl that vendor ships with backported features.
- The API to start showing progress meter after a short delay has
  been simplified.
- Code clean-up to avoid mixing values read from the .gitmodules file
  and values read from the .git/config file.
- We used to spend more than necessary cycles allocating and freeing
  piece of memory while writing each index entry out.  This has been
  optimized.
- Platforms that ship with a separate sha1 with collision detection
  library can link to it instead of using the copy we ship as part of
  our source tree.
- Code around "notes" have been cleaned up.
- The long-standing rule that an in-core lockfile instance, once it
  is used, must not be freed, has been lifted and the lockfile and
  tempfile APIs have been updated to reduce the chance of programming
  errors.
- Our hashmap implementation in hashmap.[ch] is not thread-safe when
  adding a new item needs to expand the hashtable by rehashing; add
  an API to disable the automatic rehashing to work it around.
- Many of our programs consider that it is OK to release dynamic
  storage that is used throughout the life of the program by simply
  exiting, but this makes it harder to leak detection tools to avoid
  reporting false positives.  Plug many existing leaks and introduce
  a mechanism for developers to mark that the region of memory
  pointed by a pointer is not lost/leaking to help these tools.
- As "git commit" to conclude a conflicted "git merge" honors the
  commit-msg hook, "git merge" that records a merge commit that
  cleanly auto-merges should, but it didn't.
- The codepath for "git merge-recursive" has been cleaned up.
- Many leaks of strbuf have been fixed.
- "git imap-send" has our own implementation of the protocol and also
  can use more recent libCurl with the imap protocol support.  Update
  the latter so that it can use the credential subsystem, and then
  make it the default option to use, so that we can eventually
  deprecate and remove the former.
- "make style" runs git-clang-format to help developers by pointing
  out coding style issues.
- A test to demonstrate "git mv" failing to adjust nested submodules
  has been added.
- On Cygwin, "ulimit -s" does not report failure but it does not work
  at all, which causes an unexpected success of some tests that
  expect failures under a limited stack situation.  This has been
  fixed.
- Many codepaths have been updated to squelch -Wimplicit-fallthrough
  warnings from Gcc 7 (which is a good code hygiene).
- Add a helper for DLL loading in anticipation for its need in a
  future topic RSN.
- "git status --ignored", when noticing that a directory without any
  tracked path is ignored, still enumerated all the ignored paths in
  the directory, which is unnecessary.  The codepath has been
  optimized to avoid this overhead.
- The final batch to "git rebase -i" updates to move more code from
  the shell script to C has been merged.
- Operations that do not touch (majority of) packed refs have been
  optimized by making accesses to packed-refs file lazy; we no longer
  pre-parse everything, and an access to a single ref in the
  packed-refs does not touch majority of irrelevant refs, either.
- Add comment to clarify that the style file is meant to be used with
  clang-5 and the rules are still work in progress.
- Many variables that points at a region of memory that will live
  throughout the life of the program have been marked with UNLEAK
  marker to help the leak checkers concentrate on real leaks..
- Plans for weaning us off of SHA-1 has been documented.
- A new "oidmap" API has been introduced and oidset API has been
  rewritten to use it.
- "%%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
  color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
  honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
  of the output medium.
- The http.{sslkey,sslCert} configuration variables are to be
  interpreted as a pathname that honors "~[username]/" prefix, but
  weren't, which has been fixed.
- Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
  been fixed.
- "git commit" when seeing an totally empty message said "you did not
  edit the message", which is clearly wrong.  The message has been
  corrected.
- When a directory is not readable, "gitweb" fails to build the
  project list.  Work this around by skipping such a directory.
- Some versions of GnuPG fails to kill gpg-agent it auto-spawned
  and such a left-over agent can interfere with a test.  Work it
  around by attempting to kill one before starting a new test.
- A recently added test for the "credential-cache" helper revealed
  that EOF detection done around the time the connection to the cache
  daemon is torn down were flaky.  This was fixed by reacting to
  ECONNRESET and behaving as if we got an EOF.
- "git log --tag=no-such-tag" showed log starting from HEAD, which
  has been fixed---it now shows nothing.
- The "tag.pager" configuration variable was useless for those who
  actually create tag objects, as it interfered with the use of an
  editor.  A new mechanism has been introduced for commands to enable
  pager depending on what operation is being carried out to fix this,
  and then "git tag -l" is made to run pager by default.
- "git push --recurse-submodules $there HEAD:$target" was not
  propagated down to the submodules, but now it is.
- Commands like "git rebase" accepted the --rerere-autoupdate option
  from the command line, but did not always use it.  This has been
  fixed.
- "git clone --recurse-submodules --quiet" did not pass the quiet
  option down to submodules.
- Test portability fix for OBSD.
- Portability fix for OBSD.
- "git am -s" has been taught that some input may end with a trailer
  block that is not Signed-off-by: and it should refrain from adding
  an extra blank line before adding a new sign-off in such a case.
- "git svn" used with "--localtime" option did not compute the tz
  offset for the timestamp in question and instead always used the
  current time, which has been corrected.
- Memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged.
- "git stash -u" used the contents of the committed version of the
  ".gitignore" file to decide which paths are ignored, even when the
  file has local changes.  The command has been taught to instead use
  the locally modified contents.
- bash 4.4 or newer gave a warning on NUL byte in command
  substitution done in "git stash"; this has been squelched.
- "git grep -L" and "git grep --quiet -L" reported different exit
  codes; this has been corrected.
- When handshake with a subprocess filter notices that the process
  asked for an unknown capability, Git did not report what program
  the offending subprocess was running.  This has been corrected.
- "git apply" that is used as a better "patch -p1" failed to apply a
  taken from a file with CRLF line endings to a file with CRLF line
  endings.  The root cause was because it misused convert_to_git()
  that tried to do "safe-crlf" processing by looking at the index
  entry at the same path, which is a nonsense---in that mode, "apply"
  is not working on the data in (or derived from) the index at all.
  This has been fixed.
- Killing "git merge --edit" before the editor returns control left
  the repository in a state with MERGE_MSG but without MERGE_HEAD,
  which incorrectly tells the subsequent "git commit" that there was
  a squash merge in progress.  This has been fixed.
- "git archive" did not work well with pathspecs and the
  export-ignore attribute.
- In addition to "cc: <a@dd.re.ss> # cruft", "cc: a@dd.re.ss # cruft"
  was taught to "git send-email" as a valid way to tell it that it
  needs to also send a carbon copy to <a@dd.re.ss> in the trailer
  section.
- "git branch -M a b" while on a branch that is completely unrelated
  to either branch a or branch b misbehaved when multiple worktree
  was in use.  This has been fixed.
- "git gc" and friends when multiple worktrees are used off of a
  single repository did not consider the index and per-worktree refs
  of other worktrees as the root for reachability traversal, making
  objects that are in use only in other worktrees to be subject to
  garbage collection.
- A regression to "gitk --bisect" by a recent update has been fixed.
- "git -c submodule.recurse=yes pull" did not work as if the
  "--recurse-submodules" option was given from the command line.
  This has been corrected.
- Unlike "git commit-tree < file", "git commit-tree -F file" did not
  pass the contents of the file verbatim and instead completed an
  incomplete line at the end, if exists.  The latter has been updated
  to match the behaviour of the former.
- Many codepaths did not diagnose write failures correctly when disks
  go full, due to their misuse of write_in_full() helper function,
  which have been corrected.
- "git help co" now says "co is aliased to ...", not "git co is".
- "git archive", especially when used with pathspec, stored an empty
  directory in its output, even though Git itself never does so.
  This has been fixed.
- API error-proofing which happens to also squelch warnings from GCC.
- The explanation of the cut-line in the commit log editor has been
  slightly tweaked.
- "git gc" tries to avoid running two instances at the same time by
  reading and writing pid/host from and to a lock file; it used to
  use an incorrect fscanf() format when reading, which has been
  corrected.
- The scripts to drive TravisCI has been reorganized and then an
  optimization to avoid spending cycles on a branch whose tip is
  tagged has been implemented.
- The test linter has been taught that we do not like "echo -e".
- Code cmp.std.c nitpick.
- A regression fix for 2.11 that made the code to read the list of
  alternate object stores overrun the end of the string.
- "git describe --match" learned to take multiple patterns in v2.13
  series, but the feature ignored the patterns after the first one
  and did not work at all.  This has been fixed.
- "git filter-branch" cannot reproduce a history with a tag without
  the tagger field, which only ancient versions of Git allowed to be
  created.  This has been corrected.
- "git cat-file --textconv" started segfaulting recently, which
  has been corrected.
- The built-in pattern to detect the "function header" for HTML did
  not match <H1>..<H6> elements without any attributes, which has
  been fixed.
- "git mailinfo" was loose in decoding quoted printable and produced
  garbage when the two letters after the equal sign are not
  hexadecimal.  This has been fixed.
- The machinery to create xdelta used in pack files received the
  sizes of the data in size_t, but lost the higher bits of them by
  storing them in "unsigned int" during the computation, which is
  fixed.
- The delta format used in the packfile cannot reference data at
  offset larger than what can be expressed in 4-byte, but the
  generator for the data failed to make sure the offset does not
  overflow.  This has been corrected.
- The documentation for '-X<option>' for merges was misleadingly
  written to suggest that "-s theirs" exists, which is not the case.
- "git fast-export" with -M/-C option issued "copy" instruction on a
  path that is simultaneously modified, which was incorrect.
- Many codepaths have been updated to squelch -Wsign-compare
  warnings.
- Memory leaks in various codepaths have been plugged.
- Recent versions of "git rev-parse --parseopt" did not parse the
  option specification that does not have the optional flags (*=?!)
  correctly, which has been corrected.
- The checkpoint command "git fast-import" did not flush updates to
  refs and marks unless at least one object was created since the
  last checkpoint, which has been corrected, as these things can
  happen without any new object getting created.
- Spell the name of our system as "Git" in the output from
  request-pull script.
- Fixes for a handful memory access issues identified by valgrind.
- Backports a moral equivalent of 2015 fix to the poll() emulation
  from the upstream gnulib to fix occasional breakages on HPE NonStop.
- Users with "color.ui = always" in their configuration were broken
  by a recent change that made plumbing commands to pay attention to
  them as the patch created internally by "git add -p" were colored
  (heh) and made unusable.  This has been fixed by reverting the
  offending change.
- In the "--format=..." option of the "git for-each-ref" command (and
  its friends, i.e. the listing mode of "git branch/tag"), "%%(atom:)"
  (e.g. "%%(refname:)", "%%(body:)" used to error out.  Instead, treat
  them as if the colon and an empty string that follows it were not
  there.
- An ancient bug that made Git misbehave with creation/renaming of
  refs has been fixed.
- "git fetch <there> <src>:<dst>" allows an object name on the <src>
  side when the other side accepts such a request since Git v2.5, but
  the documentation was left stale.
- Update the documentation for "git filter-branch" so that the filter
  options are listed in the same order as they are applied, as
  described in an earlier part of the doc.
- A possible oom error is now caught as a fatal error, instead of
  continuing and dereferencing NULL.


* Sat Sep 16 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.14.1-0
- This release forward-ports the fix for "ssh://..." URL from Git v2.7.6

* Sat Sep 16 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.14.0-0
- Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
  'everything matches' is still warned and Git asks users to use a
  more explicit '.' for that instead.  The hope is that existing
  users will not mind this change, and eventually the warning can be
  turned into a hard error, upgrading the deprecation into removal of
  this (mis)feature.  That is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming
  release (yet).
- Git now avoids blindly falling back to ".git" when the setup
  sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.  A corner case that
  happens to work right now may be broken by a call to die("BUG").
  We've tried hard to locate such cases and fixed them, but there
  might still be cases that need to be addressed--bug reports are
  greatly appreciated.
- The experiment to improve the hunk-boundary selection of textual
  diff output has finished, and the "indent heuristics" has now
  become the default.
- Git can now be built with PCRE v2 instead of v1 of the PCRE
  library. Replace USE_LIBPCRE=YesPlease with USE_LIBPCRE2=YesPlease
  in existing build scripts to build against the new version.  As the
  upstream PCRE maintainer has abandoned v1 maintenance for all but
  the most critical bug fixes, use of v2 is recommended.
- The colors in which "git status --short --branch" showed the names
  of the current branch and its remote-tracking branch are now
  configurable.
- "git clone" learned the "--no-tags" option not to fetch all tags
  initially, and also set up the tagopt not to follow any tags in
  subsequent fetches.
- "git archive --format=zip" learned to use zip64 extension when
  necessary to go beyond the 4GB limit.
- "git reset" learned "--recurse-submodules" option.
- "git diff --submodule=diff" now recurses into nested submodules.
- "git repack" learned to accept the --threads=<n> option and pass it
  to pack-objects.
- "git send-email" learned to run sendemail-validate hook to inspect
  and reject a message before sending it out.
- There is no good reason why "git fetch $there $sha1" should fail
  when the $sha1 names an object at the tip of an advertised ref,
  even when the other side hasn't enabled allowTipSHA1InWant.
- The "[includeIf "gitdir:$dir"] path=..." mechanism introduced in
  2.13.0 would canonicalize the path of the gitdir being matched,
  and did not match e.g. "gitdir:~/work/*" against a repo in
  "~/work/main" if "~/work" was a symlink to "/mnt/storage/work".
  Now we match both the resolved canonical path and what "pwd" would
  show. The include will happen if either one matches.
- The "indent" heuristics is now the default in "diff". The
  diff.indentHeuristic configuration variable can be set to "false"
  for those who do not want it.
- Many commands learned to pay attention to submodule.recurse
  configuration.
- The convention for a command line is to follow "git cmdname
  --options" with revisions followed by an optional "--"
  disambiguator and then finally pathspecs.  When "--" is not there,
  we make sure early ones are all interpretable as revs (and do not
  look like paths) and later ones are the other way around.  A
  pathspec with "magic" (e.g. ":/p/a/t/h" that matches p/a/t/h from
  the top-level of the working tree, no matter what subdirectory you
  are working from) are conservatively judged as "not a path", which
  required disambiguation more often.  The command line parser
  learned to say "it's a pathspec" a bit more often when the syntax
  looks like so.
- Update "perl-compatible regular expression" support to enable JIT
  and also allow linking with the newer PCRE v2 library.
- "filter-branch" learned a pseudo filter "--setup" that can be used
  to define common functions/variables that can be used by other
  filters.
- Using "git add d/i/r" when d/i/r is the top of the working tree of
  a separate repository would create a gitlink in the index, which
  would appear as a not-quite-initialized submodule to others.  We
  learned to give warnings when this happens.
- "git status" learned to optionally give how many stash entries there
  are in its output.
- "git status" has long shown essentially the same message as "git
  commit"; the message it gives while preparing for the root commit,
  i.e. "Initial commit", was hard to understand for some new users.
  Now it says "No commits yet" to stress more on the current status
  (rather than the commit the user is preparing for, which is more in
  line with the focus of "git commit").
- "git send-email" now has --batch-size and --relogin-delay options
   which can be used to overcome limitations on SMTP servers that
   restrict on how many of e-mails can be sent in a single session.
- An old message shown in the commit log template was removed, as it
  has outlived its usefulness.
- "git pull --rebase --recurse-submodules" learns to rebase the
  branch in the submodules to an updated base.
- "git log" learned -P as a synonym for --perl-regexp, "git grep"
  already had such a synonym.
- "git log" didn't understand --regexp-ignore-case when combined with
  --perl-regexp. This has been fixed.
Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
- The default packed-git limit value has been raised on larger
  platforms to save "git fetch" from a (recoverable) failure while
  "gc" is running in parallel.
- Code to update the cache-tree has been tightened so that we won't
  accidentally write out any 0{40} entry in the tree object.
- Attempt to allow us notice "fishy" situation where we fail to
  remove the temporary directory used during the test.
- Travis CI gained a task to format the documentation with both
  AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor.
- Some platforms have ulong that is smaller than time_t, and our
  historical use of ulong for timestamp would mean they cannot
  represent some timestamp that the platform allows.  Invent a
  separate and dedicated timestamp_t (so that we can distingiuish
  timestamps and a vanilla ulongs, which along is already a good
  move), and then declare uintmax_t is the type to be used as the
  timestamp_t.
- We can trigger Windows auto-build tester (credits: Dscho &
  Microsoft) from our existing Travis CI tester now.
- Conversion from uchar[20] to struct object_id continues.
- Simplify parse_pathspec() codepath and stop it from looking at the
  default in-core index.
- Add perf-test for wildmatch.
- Code from "conversion using external process" codepath has been
  extracted to a separate sub-process.[ch] module.
- When "git checkout", "git merge", etc. manipulates the in-core
  index, various pieces of information in the index extensions are
  discarded from the original state, as it is usually not the case
  that they are kept up-to-date and in-sync with the operation on the
  main index.  The untracked cache extension is copied across these
  operations now, which would speed up "git status" (as long as the
  cache is properly invalidated).
- The internal implementation of "git grep" has seen some clean-up.
- Update the C style recommendation for notes for translators, as
  recent versions of gettext tools can work with our style of
  multi-line comments.
- The implementation of "ref" API around the "packed refs" have been
  cleaned up, in preparation for further changes.
- The internal logic used in "git blame" has been libified to make it
  easier to use by cgit.
- Our code often opens a path to an optional file, to work on its
  contents when we can successfully open it.  We can ignore a failure
  to open if such an optional file does not exist, but we do want to
  report a failure in opening for other reasons (e.g. we got an I/O
  error, or the file is there, but we lack the permission to open).
  The exact errors we need to ignore are ENOENT (obviously) and
  ENOTDIR (less obvious).  Instead of repeating comparison of errno
  with these two constants, introduce a helper function to do so.
- We often try to open a file for reading whose existence is
  optional, and silently ignore errors from open/fopen; report such
  errors if they are not due to missing files.
- When an existing repository is used for t/perf testing, we first
  create bit-for-bit copy of it, which may grab a transient state of
  the repository and freeze it into the repository used for testing,
  which then may cause Git operations to fail.  Single out "the index
  being locked" case and forcibly drop the lock from the copy.
- Three instances of the same helper function have been consolidated
  to one.
- "fast-import" uses a default pack chain depth that is consistent
  with other parts of the system.
- A new test to show the interaction between the pattern [^a-z]
  (which matches '/') and a slash in a path has been added.  The
  pattern should not match the slash with "pathmatch", but should
  with "wildmatch".
- The 'diff-highlight' program (in contrib/) has been restructured
  for easier reuse by an external project 'diff-so-fancy'.
- A common pattern to free a piece of memory and assign NULL to the
  pointer that used to point at it has been replaced with a new
  FREE_AND_NULL() macro.
- Traditionally, the default die() routine had a code to prevent it
  from getting called multiple times, which interacted badly when a
  threaded program used it (one downside is that the real error may
  be hidden and instead the only error message given to the user may
  end up being "die recursion detected", which is not very useful).
- Introduce a "repository" object to eventually make it easier to
  work in multiple repositories (the primary focus is to work with
  the superproject and its submodules) in a single process.
- Optimize "what are the object names already taken in an alternate
  object database?" query that is used to derive the length of prefix
  an object name is uniquely abbreviated to.
- The hashmap API has been updated so that data to customize the
  behaviour of the comparison function can be specified at the time a
  hashmap is initialized.
- The "collision detecting" SHA-1 implementation shipped with 2.13 is
  now integrated into git.git as a submodule (the first submodule to
  ship with git.git). Clone git.git with --recurse-submodules to get
  it. For now a non-submodule copy of the same code is also shipped
  as part of the tree.
- A recent update made it easier to use "-fsanitize=" option while
  compiling but supported only one sanitize option.  Allow more than
  one to be combined, joined with a comma, like "make SANITIZE=foo,bar".
- Use "p4 -G" to make "p4 changes" output more Python-friendly
  to parse.
- We started using "%%" PRItime, imitating "%%" PRIuMAX and friends, as
  a way to format the internal timestamp value, but this does not
  play well with gettext(1) i18n framework, and causes "make pot"
  that is run by the l10n coordinator to create a broken po/git.pot
  file.  This is a possible workaround for that problem.
- It turns out that Cygwin also needs the fopen() wrapper that
  returns failure when a directory is opened for reading.
- "git gc" did not interact well with "git worktree"-managed
  per-worktree refs.
- "git cherry-pick" and other uses of the sequencer machinery
  mishandled a trailer block whose last line is an incomplete line.
  This has been fixed so that an additional sign-off etc. are added
  after completing the existing incomplete line.
- The codepath in "git am" that is used when running "git rebase"
  leaked memory held for the log message of the commits being rebased.
- "git clone --config var=val" is a way to populate the
  per-repository configuration file of the new repository, but it did
  not work well when val is an empty string.  This has been fixed.
- Setting "log.decorate=false" in the configuration file did not take
  effect in v2.13, which has been corrected.
- A few codepaths in "checkout" and "am" working on an unborn branch
  tried to access an uninitialized piece of memory.
- The Web interface to gmane news archive is long gone, even though
  the articles are still accessible via NTTP.  Replace the links with
  ones to public-inbox.org.  Because their message identification is
  based on the actual message-id, it is likely that it will be easier
  to migrate away from it if/when necessary.
- The receive-pack program now makes sure that the push certificate
  records the same set of push options used for pushing.
- Tests have been updated to pass under GETTEXT_POISON (a mechanism
  to ensure that output strings that should not be translated are
  not translated by mistake), and TravisCI is told to run them.
- "git checkout --recurse-submodules" did not quite work with a
  submodule that itself has submodules.
- "pack-objects" can stream a slice of an existing packfile out when
  the pack bitmap can tell that the reachable objects are all needed
  in the output, without inspecting individual objects.  This
  strategy however would not work well when "--local" and other
  options are in use, and need to be disabled.
- Fix memory leaks pointed out by Coverity (and people).
- "git read-tree -m" (no tree-ish) gave a nonsense suggestion "use
  --empty if you want to clear the index".  With "-m", such a request
  will still fail anyway, as you'd need to name at least one tree-ish
  to be merged.
- Make sure our tests would pass when the sources are checked out
  with "platform native" line ending convention by default on
  Windows.  Some "text" files out tests use and the test scripts
  themselves that are meant to be run with /bin/sh, ought to be
  checked out with eol=LF even on Windows.
- Introduce the BUG() macro to improve die("BUG: ...").
- Clarify documentation for include.path and includeIf.<condition>.path
  configuration variables.
- Git sometimes gives an advice in a rhetorical question that does
  not require an answer, which can confuse new users and non native
  speakers.  Attempt to rephrase them.
- A few http:// links that are redirected to https:// in the
  documentation have been updated to https:// links.
- "git for-each-ref --format=..." with %%(HEAD) in the format used to
  resolve the HEAD symref as many times as it had processed refs,
  which was wasteful, and "git branch" shared the same problem.
- Regression fix to topic recently merged to 'master'.
- The shell completion script (in contrib/) learned "git stash" has
  a new "push" subcommand.
- "git interpret-trailers", when used as GIT_EDITOR for "git commit
  -v", looked for and appended to a trailer block at the very end,
  i.e. at the end of the "diff" output.  The command has been
  corrected to pay attention to the cut-mark line "commit -v" adds to
  the buffer---the real trailer block should appear just before it.
- A test allowed both "git push" and "git receive-pack" on the other
  end write their traces into the same file.  This is OK on platforms
  that allows atomically appending to a file opened with O_APPEND,
  but on other platforms led to a mangled output, causing
  intermittent test failures.  This has been fixed by disabling
  traces from "receive-pack" in the test.
- Tag objects, which are not reachable from any ref, that point at
  missing objects were mishandled by "git gc" and friends (they
  should silently be ignored instead)
- "git describe --contains" penalized light-weight tags so much that
  they were almost never considered.  Instead, give them about the
  same chance to be considered as an annotated tag that is the same
  age as the underlying commit would.
- The "run-command" API implementation has been made more robust
  against dead-locking in a threaded environment.
- A recent update to t5545-push-options.sh started skipping all the
  tests in the script when a web server testing is disabled or
  unavailable, not just the ones that require a web server.  Non HTTP
  tests have been salvaged to always run in this script.
- "git send-email" now uses Net::SMTP::SSL, which is obsolete, only
  when needed.  Recent versions of Net::SMTP can do TLS natively.
- "foo\bar\baz" in "git fetch foo\bar\baz", even though there is no
  slashes in it, cannot be a nickname for a remote on Windows, as
  that is likely to be a pathname on a local filesystem.
- "git clean -d" used to clean directories that has ignored files,
  even though the command should not lose ignored ones without "-x".
  "git status --ignored"  did not list ignored and untracked files
  without "-uall".  These have been corrected.
- The result from "git diff" that compares two blobs, e.g. "git diff
  $commit1:$path $commit2:$path", used to be shown with the full
  object name as given on the command line, but it is more natural to
  use the $path in the output and use it to look up .gitattributes.
- The "collision detecting" SHA-1 implementation shipped with 2.13
  was quite broken on some big-endian platforms and/or platforms that
  do not like unaligned fetches.  Update to the upstream code which
  has already fixed these issues.
- "git am -h" triggered a BUG().
- The interaction of "url.*.insteadOf" and custom URL scheme's
  whitelisting is now documented better.
- The timestamp of the index file is now taken after the file is
  closed, to help Windows, on which a stale timestamp is reported by
  fstat() on a file that is opened for writing and data was written
  but not yet closed.
- "git pull --rebase --autostash" didn't auto-stash when the local history
  fast-forwards to the upstream.
- A flaky test has been corrected.
- "git $cmd -h" for builtin commands calls the implementation of the
  command (i.e. cmd_$cmd() function) without doing any repository
  set-up, and the commands that expect RUN_SETUP is done by the Git
  potty needs to be prepared to show the help text without barfing.
  (merge d691551192 jk/consistent-h later to maint).
- Help contributors that visit us at GitHub.
- "git stash push <pathspec>" did not work from a subdirectory at all.
  Bugfix for a topic in v2.13
- As there is no portable way to pass timezone information to
  strftime, some output format from "git log" and friends are
  impossible to produce.  Teach our own strbuf_addftime to replace %%z
  and %%Z with caller-supplied values to help working around this.
  (merge 6eced3ec5e rs/strbuf-addftime-zZ later to maint).
- "git mergetool" learned to work around a wrapper MacOS X adds
  around underlying meld.
- An example in documentation that does not work in multi worktree
  configuration has been corrected.
- The pretty-format specifiers like '%%h', '%%t', etc. had an
  optimization that no longer works correctly.  In preparation/hope
  of getting it correctly implemented, first discard the optimization
  that is broken.
- The code to pick up and execute command alias definition from the
  configuration used to switch to the top of the working tree and
  then come back when the expanded alias was executed, which was
  unnecessarilyl complex.  Attempt to simplify the logic by using the
  early-config mechanism that does not chdir around.
- Fix configuration codepath to pay proper attention to commondir
  that is used in multi-worktree situation, and isolate config API
  into its own header file.
  (merge dc8441fdb4 bw/config-h later to maint).
- "git add -p" were updated in 2.12 timeframe to cope with custom
  core.commentchar but the implementation was buggy and a
  metacharacter like $ and * did not work.
- A recent regression in "git rebase -i" has been fixed and tests
  that would have caught it and others have been added.
- An unaligned 32-bit access in pack-bitmap code has been corrected.
- Tighten error checks for invalid "git apply" input.
- The split index code did not honor core.sharedRepository setting
  correctly.
- The Makefile rule in contrib/subtree for building documentation
  learned to honour USE_ASCIIDOCTOR just like the main documentation
  set does.
- Code clean-up to fix possible buffer over-reading.
- A few tests that tried to verify the contents of push certificates
  did not use 'git rev-parse' to formulate the line to look for in
  the certificate correctly.
- Update the character width tables.
- After "git branch --move" of the currently checked out branch, the
  code to walk the reflog of HEAD via "log -g" and friends
  incorrectly stopped at the reflog entry that records the renaming
  of the branch.
- The rewrite of "git branch --list" using for-each-ref's internals
  that happened in v2.13 regressed its handling of color.branch.local;
  this has been fixed.
- The build procedure has been improved to allow building and testing
  Git with address sanitizer more easily.
  (merge 425ca6710b jk/build-with-asan later to maint).
- On Cygwin, similar to Windows, "git push //server/share/repository"
  ought to mean a repository on a network share that can be accessed
  locally, but this did not work correctly due to stripping the double
  slashes at the beginning.
- The progress meter did not give a useful output when we haven't had
  0.5 seconds to measure the throughput during the interval.  Instead
  show the overall throughput rate at the end, which is a much more
  useful number.
- Code clean-up, that makes us in sync with Debian by one patch.
- We run an early part of "git gc" that deals with refs before
  daemonising (and not under lock) even when running a background
  auto-gc, which caused multiple gc processes attempting to run the
  early part at the same time.  This is now prevented by running the
  early part also under the GC lock.
- A recent update broke an alias that contained an uppercase letter.

* Sat Jul 08 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.13.2-0

  Bugfix for a topic in v2.13

* Sat Jul 08 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.13.1-0
- The Web interface to gmane news archive is long gone, even though
  the articles are still accessible via NTTP.  Replace the links with

* Wed May 10 2017 Gleb Goncharov <g.goncharov@fun-box.ru> - 2.13.0-0
- Use of an empty string as a pathspec element that is used for
  'everything matches' is still warned and Git asks users to use a
  more explicit '.' for that instead.  The hope is that existing
  users will not mind this change, and eventually the warning can be
  turned into a hard error, upgrading the deprecation into removal of
  this (mis)feature.  That is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming

- The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
  has been deprecated for quite some time, and is now removed.
- The default location "~/.git-credential-cache/socket" for the
  socket used to communicate with the credential-cache daemon has
  been moved to "~/.cache/git/credential/socket".
- Git now avoids blindly falling back to ".git" when the setup
  sequence said we are _not_ in Git repository.  A corner case that
  happens to work right now may be broken by a call to die("BUG").
  We've tried hard to locate such cases and fixed them, but there
  might still be cases that need to be addressed--bug reports are
  greatly appreciated.

* Tue May 09 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.12.2-0
- "git status --porcelain" is supposed to give a stable output, but a
  few strings were left as translatable by mistake.
- "Dumb http" transport used to misparse a nonsense http-alternates
  response, which has been fixed.
- "git diff --quiet" relies on the size field in diff_filespec to be
  correctly populated, but diff_populate_filespec() helper function
  made an incorrect short-cut when asked only to populate the size
  field for paths that need to go through convert_to_git() (e.g. CRLF
  conversion).
- There is no need for Python only to give a few messages to the
  standard error stream, but we somehow did.
- A leak in a codepath to read from a packed object in (rare) cases
  has been plugged.
- "git upload-pack", which is a counter-part of "git fetch", did not
  report a request for a ref that was not advertised as invalid.
  This is generally not a problem (because "git fetch" will stop
  before making such a request), but is the right thing to do.
- A "gc.log" file left by a backgrounded "gc --auto" disables further
  automatic gc; it has been taught to run at least once a day (by
  default) by ignoring a stale "gc.log" file that is too old.
- "git remote rm X", when a branch has remote X configured as the
  value of its branch.*.remote, tried to remove branch.*.remote and
  branch.*.merge and failed if either is unset.
- A caller of tempfile API that uses stdio interface to write to
  files may ignore errors while writing, which is detected when
  tempfile is closed (with a call to ferror()).  By that time, the
  original errno that may have told us what went wrong is likely to
  be long gone and was overwritten by an irrelevant value.
  close_tempfile() now resets errno to EIO to make errno at least
  predictable.
- "git show-branch" expected there were only very short branch names
  in the repository and used a fixed-length buffer to hold them
  without checking for overflow.
- The code that parses header fields in the commit object has been
  updated for (micro)performance and code hygiene.
- A test that creates a confusing branch whose name is HEAD has been
  corrected not to do so.
- "Cc:" on the trailer part does not have to conform to RFC strictly,
  unlike in the e-mail header.  "git send-email" has been updated to
  ignore anything after '>' when picking addresses, to allow non-address
  cruft like " # stable 4.4" after the address.
- "git push" had a handful of codepaths that could lead to a deadlock
  when unexpected error happened, which has been fixed.
- Code to read submodule.<name>.ignore config did not state the
  variable name correctly when giving an error message diagnosing
  misconfiguration.
- "git ls-remote" and "git archive --remote" are designed to work
  without being in a directory under Git's control.  However, recent
  updates revealed that we randomly look into a directory called
  .git/ without actually doing necessary set-up when working in a
  repository.  Stop doing so.
- The code to parse the command line "git grep <patterns>... <rev>
  [[--] <pathspec>...]" has been cleaned up, and a handful of bugs
  have been fixed (e.g. we used to check "--" if it is a rev).
- The code to parse "git -c VAR=VAL cmd" and set configuration
  variable for the duration of cmd had two small bugs, which have
  been fixed.
  This supersedes jc/config-case-cmdline topic that has been discarded.

- Reduce authentication round-trip over HTTP when the server supports
  just a single authentication method.  This also improves the
  behaviour when Git is misconfigured to enable http.emptyAuth
  against a server that does not authenticate without a username
  (i.e. not using Kerberos etc., which makes http.emptyAuth
  pointless).
- Windows port wants to use OpenSSL's implementation of SHA-1
  routines, so let them.
- Add 32-bit Linux variant to the set of platforms to be tested with
  Travis CI.
- When a redirected http transport gets an error during the
  redirected request, we ignored the error we got from the server,
  and ended up giving a not-so-useful error message.
- The patch subcommand of "git add -i" was meant to have paths
  selection prompt just like other subcommand, unlike "git add -p"
  directly jumps to hunk selection.  Recently, this was broken and
  "add -i" lost the paths selection dialog, but it now has been
  fixed.
- Git v2.12 was shipped with an embarrassing breakage where various
  operations that verify paths given from the user stopped dying when
  seeing an issue, and instead later triggering segfault.
- The code to parse "git log -L..." command line was buggy when there
  are many ranges specified with -L; overrun of the allocated buffer
  has been fixed.
- The command-line parsing of "git log -L" copied internal data
  structures using incorrect size on ILP32 systems.

* Tue Mar 21 2017 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 2.12.0-0
- Use of an empty string that is used for 'everything matches' is
  still warned and Git asks users to use a more explicit '.' for that
  instead.  The hope is that existing users will not mind this
  change, and eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error,
  upgrading the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.  That
  is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming release (yet).
- The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
  has been deprecated for quite some time, and will be removed in a
  future release.
- An ancient script "git relink" has been removed.
- Various updates to "git p4".
- "git p4" didn't interact with the internal of .git directory
  correctly in the modern "git-worktree"-enabled world.
- "git branch --list" and friends learned "--ignore-case" option to
  optionally sort branches and tags case insensitively.
- In addition to (subject), (body), "log --pretty=format:..."
  learned a new placeholder (trailers).
- "git rebase" learned "--quit" option, which allows a user to
  remove the metadata left by an earlier "git rebase" that was
  manually aborted without using "git rebase --abort".
- "git clone --reference $there --recurse-submodules $super" has been
  taught to guess repositories usable as references for submodules of
  $super that are embedded in $there while making a clone of the
  superproject borrow objects from $there; extend the mechanism to
  also allow submodules of these submodules to borrow repositories
  embedded in these clones of the submodules embedded in the clone of
  the superproject.
- Porcelain scripts written in Perl are getting internationalized.
- "git merge --continue" has been added as a synonym to "git commit"
  to conclude a merge that has stopped due to conflicts.
- Finer-grained control of what protocols are allowed for transports
  during clone/fetch/push have been enabled via a new configuration
  mechanism.
- "git shortlog" learned "--committer" option to group commits by
  committer, instead of author.
- GitLFS integration with "git p4" has been updated.
- The isatty() emulation for Windows has been updated to eradicate
  the previous hack that depended on internals of (older) MSVC
  runtime.
- Some platforms no longer understand "latin-1" that is still seen in
  the wild in e-mail headers; replace them with "iso-8859-1" that is
  more widely known when conversion fails from/to it.
- "git grep" has been taught to optionally recurse into submodules.
- "git rm" used to refuse to remove a submodule when it has its own
  git repository embedded in its working tree.  It learned to move
  the repository away to $GIT_DIR/modules/ of the superproject
  instead, and allow the submodule to be deleted (as long as there
  will be no loss of local modifications, that is).
- A recent updates to "git p4" was not usable for older p4 but it
  could be made to work with minimum changes.  Do so.
- "git diff" learned diff.interHunkContext configuration variable
  that gives the default value for its --inter-hunk-context option.
- The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
  "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
  same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
  are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).
- "git submodule push" learned "--recurse-submodules=only option to
  push submodules out without pushing the top-level superproject.
- "git tag" and "git verify-tag" learned to put GPG verification
  status in their "--format=<placeholders>" output format.
- An ancient repository conversion tool left in contrib/ has been
  removed.
- "git show-ref HEAD" used with "--verify" because the user is not
  interested in seeing refs/remotes/origin/HEAD, and used with
  "--head" because the user does not want HEAD to be filtered out,
  i.e. "git show-ref --head --verify HEAD", did not work as expected.
- "git submodule add" used to be confused and refused to add a
  locally created repository; users can now use "--force" option
  to add them.
  (merge 619acfc78c sb/submodule-add-force later to maint).
- Some people feel the default set of colors used by "git log --graph"
  rather limiting.  A mechanism to customize the set of colors has
  been introduced.
- "git read-tree" and its underlying unpack_trees() machinery learned
  to report problematic paths prefixed with the --super-prefix option.
- When a submodule "A", which has another submodule "B" nested within
  it, is "absorbed" into the top-level superproject, the inner
  submodule "B" used to be left in a strange state.  The logic to
  adjust the .git pointers in these submodules has been corrected.
- The user can specify a custom update method that is run when
  "submodule update" updates an already checked out submodule.  This
  was ignored when checking the submodule out for the first time and
  we instead always just checked out the commit that is bound to the
  path in the superproject's index.
- The command line completion (in contrib/) learned that
  "git diff --submodule=" can take "diff" as a recently added option.
- The "core.logAllRefUpdates" that used to be boolean has been
  enhanced to take 'always' as well, to record ref updates to refs
  other than the ones that are expected to be updated (i.e. branches,
  remote-tracking branches and notes).
- Comes with more command line completion (in contrib/) for recently
  introduced options.
  - Commands that operate on a log message and add lines to the trailer
  blocks, such as "format-patch -s", "cherry-pick (-x|-s)", and
  "commit -s", have been taught to use the logic of and share the
  code with "git interpret-trailer".
- The default Travis-CI configuration specifies newer P4 and GitLFS.
- The "fast hash" that had disastrous performance issues in some
  corner cases has been retired from the internal diff.
- The character width table has been updated to match Unicode 9.0
- Update the procedure to generate "tags" for developer support.
- The codeflow of setting NOATIME and CLOEXEC on file descriptors Git
  opens has been simplified.
- "git diff" and its family had two experimental heuristics to shift
  the contents of a hunk to make the patch easier to read.  One of
  them turns out to be better than the other, so leave only the
  "--indent-heuristic" option and remove the other one.
- A new submodule helper "git submodule embedgitdirs" to make it
  easier to move embedded .git/ directory for submodules in a
  superproject to .git/modules/ (and point the latter with the former
  that is turned into a "gitdir:" file) has been added.
- "git push \\server\share\dir" has recently regressed and then
  fixed.  A test has retroactively been added for this breakage.
- Build updates for Cygwin.
- The implementation of "real_path()" was to go there with chdir(2)
  and call getcwd(3), but this obviously wouldn't be usable in a
  threaded environment.  Rewrite it to manually resolve relative
  paths including symbolic links in path components.
- Adjust documentation to help AsciiDoctor render better while not
  breaking the rendering done by AsciiDoc.
- The sequencer machinery has been further enhanced so that a later
  set of patches can start using it to reimplement "rebase -i".
- Update the definition of the MacOSX test environment used by
  TravisCI.
- Rewrite a scripted porcelain "git difftool" in C.
- "make -C t failed" will now run only the tests that failed in the
  previous run.  This is usable only when prove is not use, and gives
  a useless error message when run after "make clean", but otherwise
  is serviceable.
- "uchar [40]" to "struct object_id" conversion continues.
