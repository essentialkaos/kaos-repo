This patch hacks the Postgres configure script to prefer libncurses over
libtermcap.  This is needed in the current Fedora environment because while
both are available, libtermcap is deprecated and will be removed in the
fairly near future.  Because the need for this is short-term, I'm not
going to try to push it upstream; this patch can go away once libtermcap
is no longer present in the standard build environment.
