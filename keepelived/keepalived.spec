%description
Keepalived provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing
and high availability to Linux system and Linux based infrastructures.
The load balancing framework relies on well-known and widely used
Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing Layer4 load
balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and
adaptively maintain and manage load-balanced server pool according
their health. High availability is achieved by VRRP protocol. VRRP is
a fundamental brick for router failover. In addition, keepalived
implements a set of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine providing
low-level and high-speed protocol interactions. Keepalived frameworks
can be used independently or all together to provide resilient
infrastructures.

* Sat Jun 18 2016 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 1.2.22-0
- vrrp: Fix build without VRRP VMAC.
- Fix compilation with RFC SNMP without Keepalived SNMP.
- vrrp: Update master_adver_int when receive higher priority advert
  when master.
  If VRRPv3 is being used, and a higher priority advert is received when
  in master mode, the master_adver_int needs to be updated when transitioning
  backup mode. If this isn't done, and our advert interval is less than a third
  of the new masters, we will time out and re-enter master mode, send an advert
  to which the other master will resond with a higher priority advert, causing
  us to go back into backup mode, until our timer expires again, and this will
  continue indefinitely.
- vrrp: Don't send advert after receiving higher priority advert.
  If a master receives a higher priority advert, there is no need
  to send another advert, since the sender of the higher priority
  advert is already a master. Further, any other instance in backup
  mode will process our subsequent advert, and then consider the
  wrong system to be master, until it receives another advert from
  the real master.
  With VRRPv3, if the other master has an advert interval more than
  three times our advert interval, backup routers will be using our
  advert interval after we've sent our subsequent advert, and will
  then timeout before the new master sends another advert, prompting
  (one of) the backup routers to become a master, which will prompt
  the higher priority master to send an advert, the ex-backup router
  will then send another advert and we could end up in an endless cycle.
- vrrp: Fix receiving advert from address owner when in fault state.
- vrrp: When transitioning from fault state, log state change.
- vrrp: Fix preempt delay when transitioning from fault state.
  There were two ways of leaving fault state, either by receiving a packet
  on the instance, or by a netlink message indication that the interface is
  up again. In neither case was preempt_delay considered in the code.
  This commit changes the way vrrp->preempt_time is used. preempt_time is now
  only used once a higher priority advert is received, rather than being updated
  every time a lower priority advert is received. vrrp->preempt_time is now also
  set when transitioning out of fault state. vrrp->preempt_time.tv_sec == 0 now
  indicates the timer is not running.
- vrrp: Detect and report duplicate address owners.
  If more than one system is configured as an address owner (priority
  == 255), this would be a configuration error, and could cause
  unexpected behaviour. This commit ensures that the problem is
  reported, and sets the local instance not to be the addess owner,
  as a temporary workaround for the problem.
- vrrp: Fix maximum number of VIPs allowe.
- ipvs: Fix IPVS with IPv6 addresses.
- ipvs: Don't overwrite errno by another syscall before checking errno.
- ipvs: ipvswrapper.c: fix comparison.
- Enable compilation with development net-snmp headers.
- vrrp: Fix IPv4 vIP removal when addr matches pre-existing interface addr.
  For IPv4 vIPs keepalived adds a /32 to the underlying interface. If
  this address matches an address already configured, e.g. a /24, when
  this vIP is eventually removed due to a configuration change or
  keepalived shutdown, the original address matching the vIP, outside
  of keepalived's control, is removed instead. This behaviour is
  incorrect. The /32 added by keepalived should be the address being
  removed. Keepalived should not be touching any addresses it does not
  create.
- vrrp: Check for errors when opening VRRP data and stats files.
  This fixes crashes when running keepalived under SELinux enforcing mode,
  which does not allow keepalived proccess to write to /tmp by default.
- vrrp: Don't assume IPADDRESS_DEL == 0 and IPADDRESS_ADD != 0.
- vrrp: Fix compilation failure.
- vrrp: Fix transition to backup when receive equal priority advert from
  higher address.
  When a vrrp instance in master mode received an advert from another master
  that had equal priority, it wasn't comparing the addresses to determine
  whether it should treat the advert as higher priority, and hence the
  instance should fall back into backup state.
  When checking whether the advert is from a lower priority master, it now
  checks if the priorities are equal and then compares the addresses.
- vrrp: Optimise address comparision when receive advert in master mode.
- Optimise inet_inaddr_cmp.

* Sat Jun 18 2016 Anton Novojilov <andy@essentialkaos.com> - 1.2.21-0
- Install VRRP-MIB when applicable.
  It appears that the condition in Makefile.in for installing VRRP-MIB
  was using a non-existent macro, SNMP_RFC2_SUPPORT. This patch removes
  two conditions from Makefile.in that use undefined macros and adds a
  condition to install VRRP-MIB when SNMP_RFCV2_SUPPORT is set
  appropriately.
- Check virtual route has an interface before returning ifindex to SNMP
- Force git-commit.h to be updated when needed
- INSTALL: Keepalived doesn't need popt anymore
- INSTALL: support for 2.2 kernels is long gone.
- INSTALL: fix a few typos
- keepalived.conf(5) some minor improvements
- man keepalived(8): some minor improvements
- Add printing of smtp server port when printing global config
- timeout_epilog: mark argument const.
- parser: mark some function arguments as const.
- terminate argv with NULL.
  man execvp says: "The array of pointers must be terminated by a null
  pointer."
- ipvswrapper.c: fix comparison.
- mark pidfile strings as const.
- utils.c: mark some arguments a const.
  I left inet_stosockaddr alone for now, since it modifies the string.
  We should fix that, since we pass in strings which might be const and in
  readonly memory.
- netlink_scope_n2a: mark return type as const.
- vector->allocated is unsigned.
- notify_script_exec: mark a few arguments as const.
- vscript_print: mark string as const.
- vector->allocted is unsigned.
- dump_vscript: mark str as const.
- Updated range for virtual_router_id and priority.
- Stop segfaulting with mixed IPv4/IPv6 configuration
  After reporting that an ip address was of the wrong family, when
  the invalid address was removed from the configuration, keepalived
  was segfaulting, which was due to the wrong address being passed to
  free_list_element().
- Updated range for virtual_router_id and priority in
  doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS
- Allow '-' characters in smtp_server hostname.
- Allow smtp_server domain names with '-' characters to be parsed
  correctly.
- Report and exit if configuration file(s) not found/readable.
  The configuration file is treated as a pattern, and processed
  using glob(). If there is no matching file, then it wasn't reading
  any file, and keepalived was running with no configuration.
  This patch adds a specific check that there is at least one matching
  file, and also checks that all the configuration files are readable,
  otherwise it reports an error and terminates.
- Fix building with Linux < 3.4 when ipset development libraries
  installed.
  Prior to Linux 3.4 the ipset header files could not be included in
  userspace. This patch adds checking that the ipset headers files can
  be included, otherwise it disables using ipsets.
- configure: fix macvlan detection with musl libc.
- Fix compiling without macvlan support.
- Bind read sockets to particular interface.
  Otherwise, since we use RAW sockets, we will receive IPPROTO_VRRP
  packets that come in on any interface.
- vrrp: read_to() -> read_timeout(). Make function name less confusing.
- vrrp: open_vrrp_socket() -> open_vrrp_read_socket().
  An equivalent open_vrrp_send_socket() exists, therefore make
  the read version follow the same naming convention.
- vrrp: fix uninitialized input parameter to setsockopt().
- Make most functions in vrrp_print.c static.
- Enable compilation on Linux 4.5.x.
  Including  causes a compilation failure on Linux 4.5
  due to both  and  being included, and they have
  a namespace collision.
  As a workaround, this commit defines _LINUX_IF_H before including
  , to stop  being included. Ugly, yes,
  but without editting kernel header files I can't see any other way
  of resolving the problem.
- Fix segmentation fault when no VIPs configured.
  When checking the VIPs in a received packet, it wasn't correctly
  handling the situation when there were no VIPs configured on the
  VRRP instance.
- Improve checking of existance and readability of config files.
  There was no check of the return value from glob() in read_conf_file()
  and check_conf_file(), so that if there were no matching files, they
  attempted to use the uninitialised globbuf, with globbuf.gl_pathc taking
  a random value. A further check has been added that the files returned
  are regular files.
  Finally, if no config file name is specified check_conf_file() is now
  passed the default config file name rather than null.
- vrrp: update struct msghdr.
  The vrrp netlink code assumes an order for the members of struct msghdr.
  This breaks recvmsg and sendmsg with musl libc on mips64. Fix this by
  using designated initializers instead.
- Initialise structures by field names.
- Detection of priority == 0 seems to be shaded.
- More verbose logging on (effective) priorities.
- Log changes to effective priority made via SNMP.
- vrrp: use proper interface index while handling routes.
  It appears current code has a small typos while handling routes trying
  to access route->oif where it should be route->index.
- vrrp: make vrrp_set_effective_priority() accessible from snmp code.
  just include proper file in order to avoid compilation error.
- monotonic_gettimeofday: make static.
- Disable unused extract_content_length function.
- utils: disable more unused functions.
- utils: make inet_sockaddrtos2 static.
- signal: remove unused functions.
- Disable unused signal_ending() consistently with other unused code.
- parser: make a bunch of stuff static.
- scheduler: make a bunch of stuff static.
- scheduler: disable unused thread_cancel_event().
- vector: disable unused functions.
- vector: make 2 functions static.
- list: disable unused function.
- genhash: make some functions static.
- Remove unused variable.
- core: make a few functions static.
- checkers: make some functions static.
- vrrp_arp: make some global variables file-scope.
- vrrp_ndisk.c: make 2 global variables file-scope.
- vrrp: make some functions and globals static.
- In get_modprobe(), close file descriptor if MALLOC fails.
  The sequencing of the code wasn't quite right, and so if the MALLOC
  had failed, the file descriptor would be left open.
- Fix compilation without SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK.
  SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK weren't introduced until
  Linux 2.6.23, so for earlier kernels explicitly call fcntl().
- Don't include FIB rule/route support if kernel doesn't support it.
- Enable genhash to build without SOCK_CLOEXEC.
- Ignore O_CLOEXEC if not defined when opening and immediately closing file.
- Allow building without --disable-fwmark if SO_MARK not defined.
  configure complained "No SO_MARK declaration in headers" if that
  was the case, but --disable-fwmark was not specified. The commit
  stops the error message, and just defines _WITHOUT_SO_MARK_ if
  SO_MARK is not defined.
- Update documentation for debug option.
- Add options -m and -M for producing core dumps.
  Many systems won't produce core dumps by default. The -m option
  sets the hard and soft RLIMIT_CORE values to unlimited, thereby
  allowing core dumps to be produced.
  Some systems set /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern so that a core file
  is not produced, but the core image is passed to another process.
  The -M option overrides this so that a core file is produced, and
  it restores the previous setting on termination of the parent process,
  unless it was the parent process that abnormally terminated.
- Add option to specify port of smtp_-server.
- Add comment re when linux/if.h and net/if.h issue resolved upstream.
- Enable building with SNMP with FIB routing support.
- Exclude extraneous code when building with --disable-lvs.
- Update description of location of core files.
- Add support for throttling gratuitous ARPs and NAs.
  The commit supersedes pull request #111, and extends its functionality
  to also allow throttling of gratuitous NA messages (IPv6), and allows
  specifying the delay parameters per interface, since interfaces from
  the host may be connected to different switches, which require
  different throttling rates.
- Add snmpServerPort to Keepalived MIB.
- Add printing of smtp server port when printing global config.
- Add aggregation of interfaces for throttling ARPs/NAs.
  This commit adds support for aggregating interfaces together, so
  that if multiple interfaces are connected to the same physical switch
  and the switch is limited as a whole on the rate of gratuitous ARPs/
  unsolicited NAs it can process, the interfaces can be grouped together
  so that the limit specified is applied across them as a whole.
- In free_interface_queue, don't check LIST_ISEMPTY before freeing.
- Clear pointer freed by free_list().
- Make FREE_PTR() clear the pointer after freeing the memory.
- Make FREE() clear pointer after memory released.
  Since a pointer to allocated memory mustn't be used after the memory is
  freed, it is safer to clear the pointer. It also means that if the pointer
  is subsequently used, it shoud segfault immediately rather than potentially
  trampling over random memory, which might be very difficult to debug.
- vrrp: Improve validation of advert_int.
